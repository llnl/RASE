    Function that will extract source names from an exported detector yaml, inject those sources using GADRAS, and
    convert the GADRAS results to N42 base spectra containing RASE_senstivity tags. Output N42s will be placed in the
    RASE data directory / converted_gadras / drf_path and can be loaded into RASE as base spectra for a new detector.

    @param gadras_path: path to the GADRAS root.
    @param force: if True, every source name in the detector yaml must be recognizable by GADRAS.
