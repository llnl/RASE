Detector Influences in RASE
#############################

The influences functionality of the RASE code provides the user with a method for perturbing sampled
spectra as a way to mimic energy calibration distortions in response to the temperature, detector
bias voltage, EMI interferences, or other environmental effects.

The sampled spectra can be shifted along the energy axis using the following quadratic equation:

.. math::

   E' = C_0 + C_1 * E + C_2 * E^2

where

-  :math:`E` is the original energy bin value in the sampled spectrum (defined by the energy
   calibration of the base spectra), keV;
-  :math:`E'` is the resulting energy bin value after implementing the influence, keV;
-  :math:`C_0` is a constant offset value, keV;
-  :math:`C_1` is a linear offset coefficient (consistent with the gain change);
-  :math:`C_2` is a quadratic offset coefficient.

The default values of the coefficients are set for no spectral distortion, i.e., :math:`C_0=C_2=0`,
and :math:`C_1=1`.

Please note that the three coefficients that define the influence do not substitute the original
energy calibration coefficients that are imported from the base spectra. Any influences are applied
after the spectra are sampled. The original energy calibration coefficients are recorded in the
output .n42 sample spectra files as during the normal process.

Two additional terms, "Fixed Smear" and "Linear Smear", provide a way to distort energy resolution
by convolving a Gaussian function across the spectrum. This allows the user to simulate resolution
degradation in addition to energy calibration distortions. The two values are combined to form a
user-defined "resolution distortion term", which serve to describe the spread of the Gaussian in the
following manner:

.. math::

   \sigma_{gaussian} = \Delta E = a + b*E

where

-  :math:`\Delta E/E` is the energy resolution distortion across the energy spectrum
   (:math:`R_{User}`)

-  :math:`a` is the "Fixed Smear" term, in units of keV. This term fixes the width of the convolved
   Gaussian and provides the same broadening irrespective of energy.

-  :math:`b` is the "Linear Smear" term, in units of %. This term produces a broadening that
   provides a fixed percent broadening at any energy; in other words, the broadening varies with
   respect to energy such that the percent broadening remains constant. :math:`b` can be calculated
   via the equation:

.. math::

   b = \frac{\text{Full Width at Half Maximum}}{E_{Peak}} * 100

Note again that this term is provided in terms of percent (so if the user would like to depreciate
the resolution by one percent the value "1" should be supplied, not "0.01").

The value :math:`R_{User}`, determined the :math:`a` and :math:`b` term, is related to the
resolution of peaks in the output spectrum by the following equation:

.. math::

   R_{Final} = \sqrt{{R_{Initial}}^2 + {R_{User}}^2}

where :math:`R_{Initial}` is the resolution of the original peak and :math:`R_{Final}` is the
resolution following the convolution.

Each term in the "influences" has a "drift" term. When this term is set to a non-zero value, the
intensity of the influence will increase across the replications in an additive manner. This is
distinct from the typical meaning of replications, where they represent a simulated set of
identical, but statistically variable, measurements. As an example of how they work: if :math:`C_0`
is set to 0 and :math:`C_{0, drift}` is set to 1, :math:`C_0` in the first replication will be set
to 0, 1 in the second replication, 2 in the third, and so on. As another example, if :math:`C_1` is
set to 1 and :math:`C_{1, drift}` is set to 0.1, :math:`C_1` will be set to 1 in the first
replication, 1.1 in the second, 1.2 in the third, and so on.

Degradations can NOT be set to negative values. If any of the influences are set to a value less
than zero, or if any ever dips below zero in the process of drifting, it will automatically be set
to 0.0001 (if :math:`C_1` is exactly 0 it will default back to 1, as is the case when initially
setting the influence values).

*****************************************
A note about how influences are applied
*****************************************

When creating a sample spectrum, influences are applied to the primary spectrum but only applied to
the secondary spectrum if it is classified as an internal calibration source (i.e.: it will not be
applied to the secondary spectrum if the secondary spectrum is defined as background).

***********************
Defining an influence
***********************

An influence can be defined in one of two ways:

-  Navigate to the "Create/Edit Detector" dialogue (for example, by double-clicking on an existing
   instrument in the bottom table of the main window). Click on the "Add Influence to Detector" or
   "Modify Influences" in the bottom-left of the window.

-  Choose the "Modify Detector Influences..." option in the "setup" menu of the main GUI.

When adding an influence, only the influence(s) currently being added to the table can be changed.
When modifying influences, all influences can be modified. If any influences are left blank, they
will automatically be populated with a value of zero (meaning no additional modification of
spectra).

Deleting an influence from the influence table will remove the influence from any associated
detectors and scenarios, but will not delete those detectors/scenarios from the workflow. However,
the ID of any scenarios associated with an influence will change when that influence is deleted; any
sample spectra that had been generated for that scenario prior to deletion will no longer be
recognized by RASE.

To add an influence to a detector, select the "Add Influence to Detector" from the instrument
dialog. Highlight as many influences as desired, and click "Ok". The highlighted influences will
populate the detector influences list in the detector creation/edit dialog. Influences can be
removed from the detector by highlighting the influences and clicking the "Delete Influence from
Detector" button.

To implement an influence for an existing scenario, open the "Scenario Edit" dialogue (by
double-clicking on a scenario in the main window). Highlight the appropriate influences in the
bottom field under "Influences". Repeat the procedure for generating the sampled spectra for this
scenario. "Switch off" the influences for the same scenario to generate unperturbed spectra. Note
that scenarios with influences can only generate spectra with instruments that have had those
scenarios added to them.

NOTE: Several influences can be activated at the same time. In this case, they will be applied
sequentially to the sampled spectra (i.e.: the spectrum will be distorted by influence 1, then the
resulting spectrum will be distorted by influence 2, and so on).

Example 1. A constant shift of sampled spectra by 100 keV can be defined using the following values
for the three coefficients: :math:`C_0` = 100, :math:`C_1` = 1, :math:`C_2` = 0. Note the
:math:`C_1` = 1 is required in this case for the correct mathematical operation.

Example 2. To mimic a distortion that stretches the spectrum by 10% use the following values for the
three coefficients: :math:`C_0` = 0, :math:`C_1` = 1.1, :math:`C_2` = 0.
