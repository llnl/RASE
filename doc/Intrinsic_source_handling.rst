Working with instruments with an internal (intrinsic) calibration source
************************************************************************

Weak sources located inside the device are sometimes used in radiation detection instruments to provide continuous calibration of the energy scale and thus provide stabilization against drift due to various environmental and electronics factors. The continuous presence of such source, typically Na22 or Cs137, result in spectra that always include the source characteristic peaks in proportion with the measurement dwell time. As such, detectors with internal (also called intrinsic) sources need special handling with RASE.

Treatment of detectors with internal source depend on whether the spectrum of the internal source can be properly subtracted from the background data or not, as described below.

More robust handling of internal sources is planned for future versions of RASE.

Instruments with separable internal source
==========================================

If the internal source spectrum is known and can be subtracted from all spectra, including the background, then RASE only requires that the internal spectrum is provided as secondary so that it can be added to the sample spectra properly. More specifically:

* Create RASE base spectra where one of the secondary spectra is the internal source

* After adding base spectra to a detector, in the "Type of secondary spectrum" section of the detector creation window select "Add secondary (intrinsic activity) to sample spectra" and select the appropriate spectrum class code. 

* If the detector requires both an onboard background spectrum and an intrinsic source, either select "no secondary spectrum (other than intrinsic)" and adjust the template to explicitly include the background spectrum of interest (in which case RASE will provide the intrinsic spectrum as the secondary spectrum) or make sure that the template is configured to record the appropriate classcodes as specified in the detector creation screen. 

* Proceed with the RASE workflow as usual. Sample spectra will include the spectrum of the intrinsic source properly adjusted for the scenario dwell time.

Instruments with inseparable internal source
============================================

For certain instruments, the internal source cannot be properly subtracted from the background spectrum without introducing noticeable artifacts. Handling ot his situation is more complex:

* Create RASE base spectra as usual, leaving the background with the internal source included. Subtraction of background+internal source is usually possible for all other sources, and are therefore handled normally. Add the background with the internal source as the secondary spectrum in the base spectra.

* When adding base spectra to a detector, the user is provided the opportunity to flag with a checkbox any spectrum that contains an internal source. Upon import, the base spectra flagged in this way will see the label "wIntrinsic" added to their material name.

* Spectra flagged to include an inseparable internal source spectrum cannot be scaled by dose (or flux). If included in the scenario, they will only be scaled by the dwell time and RASE will automatically fix the dose (or flux) value.  No more than one material with intrinsic source is allowed per scenario.

* Do not select "Add secondary (intrinsic activity) to sample spectra" in the "Type of secondary spectrum" section of the detector creation window. The internal source contribution will be accounted for via its inclusion in a base spectrum file. 

The intrinsic source is an essential component of the spectrum. It is left to the user to make sure that the background with internal source present is included in the definition of any scenario to be run with a detector.
