 Models and Keywords Used in Dynamic RASE
##########################################

Dynamic RASE utilizes many keywords throughout its operation.

******************************
 Scenario paths type keywords
******************************

Each scenario block should specify a ``path``, which describes the relative motion of the sources
and the detector.

A ``path`` block, at a minimum, specifies a ``path_type``. Available options for ``path_type`` are:

StayPutPath
===========

This path describes a non-moving source. It takes a single extra parameter, ``pos``, describing the
position where the source will remain during the entire scenario.

OneStepPath
===========

This path describes a source which begins at a particular position ``firstpos`` and at
``switchtime`` teleports to ``secondpos``.

NStepPath
=========

This path describes a source that begins at one position at time = 0 and then, at N later times,
moves instantly to the next of N additional positions.

It takes a parameter ``times``, a list of length N, and a parameter ``pos``, a list of length N
+ 1 (including the first position).

InMotionPath
============

This path describes continuous motion between points. As with NStepPath, it takes a list of N + 1
positions and N times. However, at times in between the specified times the source position is
linearly interpolated between the specified points.

This path should be used for cases of simple continuous motion between two points, providing the
stop and start points as a two-element list for ``pos`` and the stop time as a one-element list for
``times``.

****************
 Spatial models
****************

Each test in the ``tests`` block should specify a ``model``, choosing from one of several models
available in Dynamic RASE.

Each test should also provide a ``model_def`` block containing parameters specific to the model.

Available model types are:

RecreateModel
=============

This model "re-creates" the input data exactly. If queried at a location where there is input data,
the model returns the spectral shape and intensity of that input data. If queried at any other
location, the model fails with an error.

This model is useful for validation of Dynamic RASE's other models against existing data. It works
well with NStepPath, but does not work with InMotionPath, as that path type requires the ability to
interpolate between input data points.

This model should be provided with a ``model_def`` consisting of:

.. code::

   model_def: ["N/A",]

ManyGPsModel
============

This model uses a Gaussian process (GP) approach to interpolation between the input data. Many GPs
are used, one per energy bin in the input spectra.

This model has an optional ``points`` parameter, a list of input data locations to use as training
points for the GPs. These must be positions available from the input data provided. If no ``points``
parameter is provided, the model will use all locations available in the input data.

ManyGPsROIModel
===============

This model is similar to the ManyGPsModel, but requires an ``roi`` parameter. This ``roi`` parameter
may either provide a list of energy bins, or sub-parameters ``first`` and ``last`` to specify a
range of energy bins. These energy bins will be modeled using GPs, while all other energy bins will
be modeled as fixed at zero counts.

Use of this model type is recommended, as specifying an ROI will reduce the time spent training GPs
in uninteresting energy bins.

ProxyModel
==========

This is an extension of the ManyGPsROIModel that uses one or more sources with many input data
locations as a "proxy" for a "target" source with only one input data location available. This is
useful for users with plentiful data taken with a common laboratory source who would like to
approximate an unusual source for which a full multi-location measurement campaign is impractical.

For each "target" source, the model will use the one location available in the input data (or the
nearest, if the user provides more than one input data location) as an "anchor" providing the
spectral shape of the target.

Next, the model will look at the ``proxies`` block in the ``model_def``. Each of these proxies
should provide a source name, an ``roi``, and a ``weight``. The proxy sources will be combined
proportionally according to the normalized weights and used to determine the relationship between
source location and bin-by-bin measurement intensity.

This relationship is combined with the spectral shape of the "anchor" to extrapolate the behavior of
the target source at other locations.

The ProxyModel is an approximation and should only be used when multi-location data is not available
for the target source.

SymmetricMGRModel
=================

This model is another extension of the ManyGPsROIModel. It uses a specialized kernel that enforces
symmetry around an axis provided by a ``reflection_axis`` parameter, which should be provided as a
list of [x, y, z] coordinates.

****************
 Scoring models
****************

Only a few relatively basic scorers are currently implemented in Dynamic RASE. The scoring system is
designed to be extensible and more sophisticated scorers can be included by the developers if
desirable approaches to comparing model versus true spectra are proposed.

The currently implemented scoring models require that the points at which scores are requested have
base spectra at that point to use as a basis for comparison. To get a good idea of the models, it
may be a good idea to leave one or more training points out of the model definition such that
scoring is not done on training points, giving an overly optimistic performance evaluation. This is
not ideal if collected data is sparse and every point has great significance; in this case, one
possible approach would be to define several tests using the same scenario and model but leave a
single, different training point out each time. Scoring can then be done on that excluded point for
each model, giving an overall idea of how stable the model is when using all the points as well as
how important each point is for smooth and accurate simulation.

ScoreMaxDifference
==================

This scorer returns the single largest difference between any bin in the model and any of the input
data for the source, among all provided locations.

This single largest difference will generally be at a spectra peak and at the closest location, as
this results in the greatest counts in the input spectrum and therefore offers the largest
difference in a well-functioning model. This can be reasonably predictive of source detection
behavior, as detecting a source is greatly influenced by spectral peaks and the behavior at the
closest approach, but this predictive relationship is very approximate.

ScoreMaxDifferenceDivTotalCounts
================================

This scorer divides the maximum difference between input and model across all energy bins by the
total counts in the input spectra at each location. The greatest difference / total counts ratio
across all locations is the resulting score.

This approach, unlike ScoreMaxDifference, is not primarily determined by discrepancies at the
point of closest approach. As a result, it may be useful in scenarios where it is especially
important that the model be accurate over the entire field.

ScoreMaxDifferenceAcrossROI
===========================

This scorer takes an ``roi`` parameter with ``first`` and ``last`` sub-parameters to provide a range
of energy bins over which the scorer looks. It otherwise behaves like ScoreMaxDifference.

*****************
 Plotting models
*****************

There are several options for plotting a simulation. The user can choose to plot things in 3D, where
a detector response map for a bin (or bins) of interest will be plotted, or in 2D, where the
detector response map along a linear path will be plotted. The different possible plotting models
are noted here. Note that the user can assign multiple plotter models to the same spectrum. Dynamic
RASE does not check to make sure that all models defined for a plot are compatible, so the user
should take care to make sure that the models being defined together are sensible.

plot_3D_model
=============

This model simply plots the 3D detector response surface across all space. This map is currently
only capable of plotting the detector response map across the X-Y plane, with the Z axis indicating
the intensity of the response. This model is selected by setting the ``dimensions`` keyword to 3 and
defining this model as one of the members of the ``plotter`` keyword list. The user can choose to
either plot the detector response map in real space or in 1/r^2 adjusted "model" space, but using
the words `real` or `model` for the ``plot_type`` keyword. The user then defines a list of tests for
the ``test`` keyword. Each test defined here will create a different plot. The user can define
limits for the plots using the ``limits`` keyword, which has the sub-keywords of ``X``, ``Y`` and
``Z``. Each of these keywords expects a 2-element list. If not included, the plots default to X =
[-301, 301] and Y = [29, 301]. In the current implementation of Dynamic RASE, the ``Z`` component is
ignored but should still be defined as a list of 2 numbers. Finally, the user can plot one or more
bins by defining a list for the ``bin`` keyword. As with the tests, each bin will create a uniquely
generated plot.

plot_3D_train
=============

This model plots training points in 3D. If the user would like to visualize the training data or the
test data without the detector response map, this is the model to use. Alternatively, the
"plot_3D_model" and "plot_3D_points" can be plotted together to visualize the detector response and
the training points used to create that response. This model uses all the same keywords as
"plot_3D_model", with the added keyword ``plot_error``. The ``plot_error`` keyword can either take a
True or False. If the keyword is not specified or nothing is provided here, it defaults to False.

plot_3D_train_colored_by_model
==============================

This model is the same as plot_3D_train and takes all the same keywords. The only difference is that
this model also gives the points unique coloration and symbols depending on where it lies relative
to the detector response map. If the values of the points are within 5% of the response map, they
will be green circles, regardless of whether they are above or below the response map. If they are
further than 5% away, they will be blue circles (if less than the map) or red circles (if greater).
If the difference is greater than 20%, the symbols are triangles (with the same coloration as for
the 5%–20% case), and if greater than 50% they are squares (again with the same coloration). The
user should choose to either use "plot_3D_train" or "plot_3D_train_colored_by_model", not both.

plot_3D_test/plot_3D_test_colored_by_model
==========================================

These models are identical to the two models above in terms of functionality. The difference is that
these models plot test data, not training data. The test data selected to plot is defined using the
``scorer`` keyword. This keyword expects only a single value: the name of a scorer from which to
source test points. This keyword is mandatory if using either of these two models. The user is free
to use the "plot_3D_model", "plot_3D_train"/"plot_3D_train_colored_by_model", and
"plot_3D_test"/"plot_3D_test_colored_by_model" together in a single plotter to create a full
visualization of an entire model.

plot_2D_fixed_phi
=================

In this model, a 2D slice going from [0, 0, 0] through some user-specified point is plotted as a line.
This line indicates the shape of the detector response function along that path. Plotting 2D figures
takes the same keywords as plotting 3D figures, with the ``dimensions`` keyword set to 2 and with
the only additional keyword being ``position``. This keyword expects a 3-element list of X, Y, and Z
coordinates indicating the point that the 2D slice should pass through. The limits for 2D plots are
the same as for 3D plots, defined using the ``limts`` keyword and with the same default values. 2D
plots always plot training points by default, but will only plot test points if a scorer is defined.
Furthermore, 2D plots will only plot points that the 2D slice directly passes through.

plot_2D_fixed_radius
====================

This model is identical to the "plot_2D_fixed_phi" model except that the point specifies a radial
distance, not an angular slice. The plot generated for a fixed radius model will create a plot at
all angles at a single radial distance from [0, 0, 0], with limits defined by the ``limits`` keyword
(and with the same defaults as in the 3D plots).

plot_2D_fixed_line
==================

This model defines the path between two points along a line. The only different keyword behavior
here is that the ``position`` keyword expects a list of 3-element lists, in the form [ [X_1, Y_1,
Z_1], [X_2, Y_2, Z_2] ]. The points provided must be within the limits of the plot.
